This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling. The `isset()` function checks if a variable is set and is not NULL. However, it does not explicitly check the variable's type.  If `$_GET['id']` is set to the string "0", `isset($_GET['id'])` will return true, yet the following `if` condition will evaluate to false because  `$_GET['id']` is treated as a string, which is considered falsy in a boolean context. This leads to unexpected behavior where the intended functionality for ID 0 is bypassed.
